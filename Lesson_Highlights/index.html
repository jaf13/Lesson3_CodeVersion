            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are such things as a Git Repository. You have a project, and this project would then be imported into a repository. With that project there, one can "pull" the project out, edit it however, and "push" it back into the repository. This would then create another project, not deleting the first one, so that you have a "branch"or a thread of all of the edited projects. It would be a clone of the original which could be pulled and edited and pushed as many times as one wants, without overwriting the previous edit. This is all done in a Git Repository, basically a library for all of these edited projects. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">What to type to make things work</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are many different commands when using Git, but there are a few basics:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    git init: creates an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one
                </li>
                <li>
                    git commit -m: commit changes to head (but not yet to the remote repository)
                </li>
                <li>
                    git commit -a: commit files you've added with git add and files you've changed since then
                </li>
                <li>
                    git branch: lists all the branches and tells you what branch you're already in
                </li>
                <li>
                    git branch -d: delete's the feature branch
                </li>
                <li>
                    git checkout: switch between branches
                </li>
                <li>
                    git reset: moves head and current branch back to wherever is specified. Undos a commit that you no longer needed
                </li>
                <li>
                    git revert: to undo comits that have already been pushed and shared
                </li>
                <li>
                    git merge: creates a new commit with two parents resulting in a snapshot of the work done in both branches
                </li>
                <li>
                    git rebase: takes the commits on this branch and moves them so that their new base is at the point specified
                </li>
                <li>
                    git fetch: updates all of the remote tracking branches in the local repository
                </li>
                <li>
                    git pull: does a git fetch then a git merge of the remote tracking branch associated with the current branch
                </li>
                <li>
                    git push: finds the commits you have on your local branch and sends them to the remote repository
                </li>
                </ul></p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems automatically records the who, what and when about files. Multiple people can work on it at the same time. Files are backed up regardless of what is done, it processes faster, and everything is local. Using a git repository is like using a library; what you check out is always still there and what you put back will be recorded as a new book while the old one still remains.</p>
